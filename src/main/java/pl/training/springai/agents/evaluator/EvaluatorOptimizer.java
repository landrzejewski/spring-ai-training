/**
 * One model generates, another scores, and the feedback goes back to the generator.
 * <pre>
 * [Generator] -> output -> [Evaluator] -> score below threshold?
 *      ^                                       |
 *      |-------------- feedback ---------------|
 *                                              v
 *                                score at or above threshold -> Output
 * </pre>
 * This is the only pattern in the package with a feedback edge: the number of steps is decided at
 * runtime by the scores, not fixed in advance.
 * <p>
 * It works because the evaluation is structured output - a number per criterion plus written
 * feedback - which the next generation prompt can act on. Asking a model to "improve this" without
 * telling it what was wrong changes the output without improving it.
 * <p>
 * The costs are real: every iteration is two model calls, and the loop can plateau, polishing an
 * approach that was wrong from the start rather than reconsidering it. maxIterations bounds both.
 * <p>
 * Spring AI's own Evaluator API (RelevancyEvaluator, FactCheckingEvaluator) is the framework's
 * take on the evaluation half of this idea, with the criteria and prompts provided.
