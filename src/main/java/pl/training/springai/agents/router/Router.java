/**
 * Classifies an incoming request with one model call, then hands it to a specialised handler.
 * <pre>
 * Input -> [LLM classifier] -> category -> [category handler] -> Output
 * </pre>
 * The classification uses structured output, so the category arrives as an enum constant rather
 * than as prose to be matched. Two model calls happen per request - a cheap, narrow classification
 * and an expensive, specialised answer - which is usually cheaper than one prompt carrying the
 * instructions for every category at once.
 * <p>
 * The reason to classify with a model rather than with keyword rules is that it reads intent:
 * "I cannot pay with my card" is billing without containing the word invoice, and an ambiguous
 * message still gets a category plus a confidence score the caller can act on.
