 * It is the model's own estimate, so treat it as a hint, not a measurement.
 *
 * @param originalTicket the customer message
 * @param category the assigned category
 * @param confidence the model's confidence, 0.0 to 1.0
 * @param reasoning why the model chose this category
 * @param handlerResponse the specialised handler's reply
