 * This is a structured output type, so the field names and their descriptions are what the model
 * is asked to fill in. The dependency list is the important one: it turns a flat list of ideas
 * into an executable order, and getting the model to state dependencies explicitly is what makes
 * the pattern work at all.
 * <p>
 * Decomposing "Build a REST API for a todo app" typically yields the Todo model with no
 * dependencies, the repository depending on the model, the service depending on the repository.
