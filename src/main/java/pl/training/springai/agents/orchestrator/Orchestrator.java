/**
 * A central model call decomposes the request into tasks, workers execute them in dependency
 * order, and a final call integrates the results.
 * <p>
 * What distinguishes this from the other patterns is where the plan comes from. Chain has a fixed
 * sequence and ParallelizerAction a fixed task list; here the task list, their dependencies and
 * their priorities are structured output from the model, so the same code handles requests whose
 * shape nobody anticipated.
 * <p>
 * That flexibility is also the risk: the model can produce an unworkable plan, and nothing
 * downstream will notice. maxWorkers bounds the damage.
