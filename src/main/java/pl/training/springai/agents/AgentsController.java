/**
 * Agentic workflow patterns, implemented on top of the plain ChatClient API.
 * <p>
 * An AI agent is a system in which the LLM directs the flow of work instead of following a fixed
 * script. Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" distinguishes three levels:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Augmented LLM - a model with retrieval, tools and memory;</li>
 *   <li>Agentic workflows - the model steers a flow built from predefined patterns;</li>
 *   <li>Autonomous agents - the model decides everything, including its own control flow.</li>
 * </ol>
 * This controller implements <b>level 2</b>. Nothing here is a Spring AI feature: every pattern is
 * assembled from ChatClient calls and structured output, which is exactly the point - once the
 * model can return typed objects reliably, the orchestration is ordinary Java.
 *
 * <h2>The five patterns</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Prompt chaining</b> - the task is split into a sequence of steps and the output of step
 *       N becomes the input of step N+1. Each step gets a narrow, specialised prompt.
 *       Example: analyse code -&gt; suggest improvements -&gt; refactor. {@code POST /agents/chain}</li>
 *   <li><b>Routing</b> - the model classifies the input and a specialised handler takes over.
 *       Unlike keyword rules it understands context and phrasing. {@code POST /agents/route}</li>
 *   <li><b>Parallelization</b> - independent subtasks run concurrently and the results are
 *       aggregated. Model calls are IO-bound, so virtual threads fit naturally.
 *       {@code POST /agents/parallel}</li>
 *   <li><b>Orchestrator-workers</b> - one model call decomposes the request into tasks with
 *       dependencies, workers execute them, and the orchestrator integrates the results. The task
 *       list is decided at runtime, not hard-coded. {@code POST /agents/orchestrate}</li>
 *   <li><b>Evaluator-optimizer</b> - generate, score against explicit criteria, improve, repeat
 *       until the score is good enough or the iteration budget runs out.
 *       {@code POST /agents/optimize}</li>
 * </ol>
 * Compare the last one with Spring AI's own Evaluator API (RelevancyEvaluator,
 * FactCheckingEvaluator, exercised in {@code src/test/java/.../evaluation}): the same
 * generate-evaluate-improve idea, but with the criteria and the scoring provided by the framework.
 * <p>
 * Request bodies for all five endpoints are in client.http.

 * @see Router
 * @see ParallelizerAction
